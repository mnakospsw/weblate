    "other": "<p class=\"mat-title\">1. Interest Rate Determination</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 36px;\">\r\n\tA loan’s interest rate depends on the type of loan, the borrower’s credit score and \r\n\tif the loan is secured or unsecured. A loan may also require collateral, which is a \r\n\tmaterial asset that can be taken by the lender if the loan isn’t paid. State and federal \r\n\tlaws regulate how high interest can be. Interest conditions, and whether it is fixed \r\n\t(remains the same amount) or floating (changes over time), will be spelled out in the loan. \r\n\tFloating fee rates are adjusted periodically and generally are only used in complex \r\n\tloans like adjustable-rate home mortgages.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"mat-title\">2. Contract Length and Amortization</p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 36px;\">\r\n\tOnce the lender and the borrower have determined the amount of money the loan is for, \r\n\tthe lender will use an amortization table to calculate what the monthly payment will \r\n\tbe by dividing the number of payments to be made and adding the interest onto the monthly payment. \r\n\tThe longer it takes to pay, the more expensive the mortgage is. For instance, \r\n\tif you borrowed $200,000, with 4% interest on a 30-year mortgage, you would pay $343,739 over the life of the mortgage.\r\n\tMost mortgage loans allow early payoffs without penalty, and it’s a good idea to take \r\n\tadvantage of that, or to pay more than required toward to the principal every month. \r\n\tThe faster the loan debt is retired, the less money it costs.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"mat-title\">3. Pre-Payment Fees and Penalties</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSome loans come with pre-paid fees and penalties for paying off early. \r\n\tPrepayment penalties are typically found in automobile loans or in mortgage \r\n\tsubprime loans. Refinancing a home or auto loan may also have pre-payment penalties. \r\n\tThese are to protect the lender, who expects a certain return on his loan over a certain\r\n\tamount of time. For example, if the borrower repays a five-year loan in three years, \r\n\tthe lender loses the profit from interest that was expected the last two years of the loan.\r\n\tPrepayment penalties usually are 2% of the amount due, or six months of interest payments.\r\n\tIt can have a dramatic effect on the cost of refinancing a loan. Many sub-prime loans include \r\n\tprepayment penalties, which opponents say target the poor, who usually are the ones with such loans. \r\n\tGovernment-backed FHA loans are protected by federal law from prepayment penalties \r\n\tunless the borrower has a mortgage that has a due-on-sale clause.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"mat-title\">3. Breach or Default</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf a borrower misses payments, or a loan contract is paid off late, the loan is considered in default. \r\n\tThe borrower can be liable for potential legal damages to compensate the lender for losses suffered.\r\n\tThe breached or defaulted lender can pursue litigation and have a court hold the borrower liable for legal \r\n\tcosts, liquidated damages and even have assets and property attached or sold for repayment of the debt. \r\n\tIn addition, a breach or default of court judgment can be placed on the borrower’s credit record.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"mat-title\">3. Mandatory Arbitration</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMandatory arbitration requires the borrower and lender to resolve disputes through an arbitrator, \r\n\trather than the court system. More than 50% of lending institutions include mandatory arbitration as \r\n\tpart of their loan contracts because it is supposed to be faster and cheaper than going to court. \r\n\tArbitration puts the final decision in the hands of one person, who likely is more experienced and \r\n\tsophisticated about the law than six jurors in a courtroom.\r\n\tMandatory arbitration tends to favor lenders, who have legal counsel that specialize in the process. \r\n\tThe borrower often has no, or inadequate representation, because lawyers are not guaranteed payment in arbitration cases.\r\n\tThere is no appeal after an arbitration decision, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Truth in \r\n\tLending Act have no bearing, also putting borrowers at a disadvantage.\r\n\tMilitary personnel serving overseas are especially vulnerable to mandatory arbitration in loan agreements. \r\n\tThey may not be able to attend or have representation at an arbitrary hearing back home, meaning they could lose their vehicle.\r\n\tIf a loan agreement includes a mandatory arbitration clause, decide before signing it whether you are \r\n\tcomfortable with that as a means of settling disputes.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"mat-title\">3. Usury and Predatory Protections</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFederal and state consumer protection laws guard against predatory and usury loan \r\n\ttactics used by lenders. The Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Act and \r\n\tthe Homeowners Protection Act federally protect borrowers against predatory lenders. \r\n\tMany states enacted companion consumer predatory and usury protection acts to protect borrowers. \r\n\tBoth parties benefit because lenders make reasonable interest repayment rates and borrowers receive a much-needed loan.\r\n</p>"
